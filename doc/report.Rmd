## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(drake)
head(readd(data))
```

## Showing Coefficients

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
loadd(coefs)
colnames(coefs)  <-  c('Intercept', 'GDP per capita slope', 'Year slope')
kable(round(coefs, 3), caption = 'Table 1. Summary of statistics')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
readd(figure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
